# ðŸ’¡ Native Framework

This project was developed as part of an engineering start-up, of which the explicit context can not be shared.  The develoment was done under extreme time pressure and there are numerous things that I would love to correct.

This framework enables the user to develop a native dekstop application with the primary focus of performance.  The end goal had extremely intensive situations in mind, and the framework had to be designed from the ground up with these goals in mind.

The framework was going to be open-sourced and the specific application kept closed-source.  However, due to unforseen circumstances, this repository will no longer be used in an official context.

## Documentation

Wrote *some* documentation, but it does not come close to covering everything.  See [this directory](https://github.com/AlexvZyl/Lumen/tree/Main/ElecDev_Graphics_Application/Documentation).

## Santisation

There are some things I want to do before archiving the repository.  See https://github.com/AlexvZyl/Lumen/issues/452.
