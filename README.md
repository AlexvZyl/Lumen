# Lumen Design Engine

This project was developed as part of a start-up, of which the explicit application can not be shared.  The develoment was done under extreme time pressure and there are numerous things that I would love to correct.  For example, using cmake as the build script and removing the boost dependency.

This project is no longer going to be used, but I would like to round some things off before archiving it.  This was extremely fun, and I hope to be able to work on something like this again.
